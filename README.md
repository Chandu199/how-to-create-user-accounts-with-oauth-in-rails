## Instructor: [José Mota][instructor url]


Ruby on Rails is a great framework for quickly and easily build applications for the web. It's a framework designed with developer productivity and happiness in mind. However there are lots of commonly-required features that Rails doesn't support out of the box. You can always roll your own solutions, but the best case is to use a community-created gem.

In this course, Tuts+ instructor José Mota will show you how to use some of the most commonly-needed gems for Rails apps. You'll learn about gems that improve the debugging experience, that help with user authorization and authentication, that run tasks, perform search, protect data and more! You'll also learn about some really crucial testing gems along the way.

So let's get started!
