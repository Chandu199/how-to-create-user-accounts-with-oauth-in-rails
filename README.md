## Instructor: [Jos√© Mota][instructor url]


Ruby on Rails is an open-source framework that allows you to quickly and easily build applications for the web. It's a framework designed with developer productivity and happiness in mind. With Rails you can create web applications with very little effort through strong conventions, sensible defaults and a great set of libraries. If you want to get started building web applications, Ruby on Rails is a great place to start!

In this course, you'll learn about developing web applications with Ruby on Rails. We will build a simple task and project management tool together. In so doing, we'll cover the foundations of Rails: models, controllers and views. We'll also go further, touching on most of the key features of the Rails framework: validations, migrations, the asset pipeline, email delivery, internationalization, AJAX integration and more!
