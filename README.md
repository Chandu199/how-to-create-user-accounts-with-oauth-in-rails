# [How to Create User Accounts With OAuth in Rails][published url]
## Instructor: [José Mota][instructor url]


OAuth is the most common authorization protocol in use today, and is supported by popular web apps like GitHub, Google and Facebook. With OAuth, users can log in to your site without needing to create a separate login name and password. This is convenient for your users and lowers the barrier to new sign ups.

This course, from Envato Tuts+ instructor José Mota, explains how to use OAuth in a web application. Follow along as José adds an OAuth login system to an already-existing Rails applicantion. You'll get a high-level view of how OAuth works, and you'll learn how to use the OmniAuth gem together with Devise, to create a robust, OAuth-compliant authentication system for Ruby on Rails.
